  <p class="writeups-intro">Documenting my learning in public — each writeup breaks down the challenge, my methodology, tools used, and key takeaways. Inspired by the idea that teaching others is the best way to cement your own understanding.</p>

    <div class="writeup-title">Bandit Wargame: Level 0 → 15</div>
    <p class="writeup-body">Documented my progression through the Bandit wargame — SSH basics, file system navigation, hidden files, setuid binaries, and Bash scripting. Each level covers the challenge, my approach, commands used, and why they worked.</p>

      <span class="takeaway-label">Key Takeaway</span>
      Understanding <code>chmod</code>, <code>find</code>, and file permissions isn't just theory — these are exactly the misconfigurations I look for when doing vulnerability assessments.

    <div class="writeup-title">Network Enumeration &amp; Service Discovery</div>
    <p class="writeup-body">Practised identifying open ports, running services, and potential entry points. Write-ups document the business risk each exposed service represents — an exposed SMB port isn't just a finding, it's a potential lateral movement vector.</p>
    <div class="writeup-takeaway">
      <span class="takeaway-label">Key Takeaway</span>
      Framing every finding in terms of impact — "what could an attacker do with this?" — made my Nessus reports at ST Engineering significantly more actionable.

    <p class="writeup-body">After completing the Cisco course I wrote a personal summary of the core concepts: CIA triad, attack types, social engineering, and basic cryptography — in plain language as if explaining to a non-technical friend, which revealed gaps I then went back to fill.</p>
    <div class="writeup-takeaway">
      <span class="takeaway-label">Key Takeaway</span>
      Every security decision I make now maps back to: does this protect Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability?
