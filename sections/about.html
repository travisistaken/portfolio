  <div class="about-text">
    <p>I am a <strong>Cybersecurity &amp; Networking graduate from Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>, with a strong interest in protecting digital systems and infrastructure. Before NYP, I completed my Higher NITEC in Electronics Engineering at ITE College Central, where I made the Director's List and received the NYAA Bronze Award.</p>
    <p>I interned at <strong>ST Engineering</strong> for 8 months as an Information Security Intern, performing vulnerability assessments with Tenable Nessus, managing backup operations with Arcserve, configuring access controls, and documenting compliance evidence.</p>
    <p>Outside of school, I sharpen my skills through <strong>HackTheBox</strong> and <strong>OverTheWire Bandit</strong>, practising penetration testing, Linux command-line, and Bash scripting. I believe cybersecurity is a mindset, not just a skill set.</p>
